The Application
=======================================================

This is a simple application to demonstrate the properties of a normal distribution. 

It is deployed at: https://edmondhylau4.shinyapps.io/Shiny-Project/

By default the application loads a standard normal distribtion with mean($\mu$)=0 and standard deviation($\sigma$)=1.

The application allows the user to: 

- Generate a normal disbution based on a mean and standard distribution
- Calculate the probabilty of the tail region - left, right, both tails or in between both tails.

Normal Distribution: Intro
========================================================

In probability theory, the normal (or Gaussian) distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution and used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.

- The probability density of the normal distribution is:
\[
f(x \ | \ \mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{{-(x-\mu)^2}/{2\sigma^2}}
\]
- When a random variable X is distributed normally with mean $\ \mu$ and variance$\ \sigma^2$, it is denoted as $\ X \sim N (\ \mu,\ \sigma^2)$
- The simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution. This is a special case when $\ \mu=0$ and $\ \sigma=1$.

Normal Distribution: Properties
========================================================
- It is symmetric around the point x = $\mu$, which is the mean, median and mode of the distribution.
- The area under the curve and over the x-axis is unity.
- 3-sigma rule or 68-95-99.7 (empirical) rule:
    - About 68% of values drawn from the distribution are within 1 $\sigma$ away from the mean. About 95% of the values lie within 2 $\sigma$. About 99.7% are within 3 $\sigma$.

Normal Distribution: R functions
=======================================================

```{r}
#dnorm: 5 sample normal distribution
xlim <- 0 + c(-1,1)*3.5*1;
x <- seq(xlim[1]-diff(range(xlim))/4, xlim[2]+diff(range(xlim))/4, length.out=5); y <- dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)
str(data.frame("x"=x,"y"=y))
```

```{r}
#pnorm: Lower tail probability at -1.96
pnorm(-1.96, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)
```


Normal Distribution: Approximations
=======================================================
The central limit theorem implies that certain distributions can be approximated by the normal distribution.
- The binomial distribution B(n, p) is approximately normal with mean np and variance np(1-p) for large n and for p not too close to zero or one.
- The Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$ is approximately normal with mean $\lambda$ and variance $\lambda$, for large values of $\lambda$.
- The chi-squared distribution $\chi^2$(k) is approximately normal with mean k and variance 2k, for large k.
- The Student's t-distribution t(v) is approximately normal with mean 0 and variance 1 when v reaches 30 for a 3.5% deviation at 95% of the upper tail. For 120 samples, the difference is less than 1%.
